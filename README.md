Overview:
hWolf3D
- hWolf3D is a port by Keripo of Wolfenstein 3D Linux to
  iPodLinux using the hotdog graphics engine. Wolfenstein
  3D Linux is a port of the original id game Wolfenstein
  3D and its prequel Spear of Destiny.
- hWolf3D runs near full speed and works on all colour iPods.
  There is no support for monochrome iPods as hotdog does
  not seem to work on monochrome iPods.
- hWolf3D allows for strafing when centre is held and pixel
  blending has also been added for slightly smoother graphics.
- The ZeroSlackr version includes Wolfenstein 3D shareware
  files and Spear of Destiny demo files.
For more information, see:

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_of_Destiny_(computer_game)

Usage:
- FastLaunch either Wolf3D or SoD shareware or retail
  versions through "Media > hWolf3D".
- If you legally own data files for the retail versions,
  copy those data files to the corresponding folder.
- Note that game saving and loading does NOT seem to work
  takes over 10 minutes to save a game and the game
  save seems corrupt). I do not know how to fix this
  unfortunately, so just do not save your game.
